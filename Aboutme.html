    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Born on 14th march 1879 at Ulm in the Kingdom of Wurttemberg in the German Empire. He is best
        known for developing the theory of relativity and also made important contributions to
        quantum mechanics. His mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc2 has been called " The world's
        most famous equation". Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age
        of five. When he was eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the
        Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium) where he received advanced primary and then secondary school
        education. In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship
        of the German Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in order to avoid conscription into military
        service.[36] The Matura (graduation for the successful completion of higher secondary
        schooling) awarded to him in the September of that year acknowledged him to have performed
        well across most of the curriculum, allotting him a top grade of 6 for history, physics,
        algebra, geometry, and descriptive geometry.[37] At seventeen, he enrolled in the four-year
        mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school. Marie
        Winteler, a year older than him, took up a teaching post in Olsberg, Switzerland.</p>
